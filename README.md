# notes-summary-scorer

This is a project inspired by the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/)
for learning material. While the Feynman Technique emphasizes being
able to explain/teach things in simple terms, we seek to evaluate a
summarization of recalled material, which is in a similar vein of
learning and retaining new information.
